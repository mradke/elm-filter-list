# List filter in elm

This is a naiive implementation of a simple filtering List in Elm.
It is stable for up to 5000 entries but will start to look jagged beyond that.

I also started a sample implementation for larger datasets (read: up to 60000 tested until now), but it is nowhere near ready. If of interest you can find the code in the `large-datasets` branch.

If you are looking for a more comprehensive example, or need sorting functionality you will be better off looking into `evancz/elm-sortable-table`.
